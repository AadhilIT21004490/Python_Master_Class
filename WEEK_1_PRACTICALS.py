# print("Age's DataType is: ",type(age))

# 02.Take an integer input and check whether the number is even or odd using if-else.
# num = input("Enter the Number : ")
# num = int(num)
#
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print("Number is Even")
# else:
#     print("Number is Odd")

# 03.Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using a for loop.
# num = [1,3,4,6,2,6,3]
# total = 0
#
# for i in num:
#     total = total + i
#
# print(total)

# 04.Create a list of 5 numbers and Print the list ,Print the first and last elements

# listss = [2,5,6,3,8]
#
# for num in listss:
#     print(num)
# print("----------------------------\n")
#
# print(listss[0],listss[4])

# 05.Count Items in a List and Given a list of numbers, count how many numbers are greater than 10.

# num = [12,3,54,2,33,332,1,12]
# count = 0
# count10 = 0
#
# for i in num :
#     count = count + 1
#
# print("Total Count is : ",count)
# print(" ")
#
# for j in num:
#     if j > 10 :
#         count10 = count10 + 1
# print("Total Numbers Greatr than 10 : ",count10)

# 06.Create a tuple with 3 values (name, age, city) and print them separately.
